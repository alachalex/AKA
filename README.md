# AKA

The BACKPaka was a fully functional group project created for the Introduction to General Engineering class at NYU. It was produced alongside Kaitlin So and Ayman Siam. The BACKPaka monitors conditions of the user's posture to determine when they are slouching, and correct their posture using soft robotics. Arduino was used as the main processor, and the soft robotics components were made from silicone bodies that inflated with air pumps. 


This is the Arduino code for reading pressure sensors and changing the power of a motor accordingly. See more about this project on my website.
